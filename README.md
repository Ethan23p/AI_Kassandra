The eventual tech stack:
	- ## Tech Stack
		- ### Modern & Minimal
			- **Backend:** Bun + Hono (TypeScript/JavaScript)
			- **Frontend:** HTMX 2.0 + JSX templates (via Hono)
			- **Notify:** SSE via Hono
			- **Database:** SQLite via bun:sqlite (native)
	- Guiding Principles, will become more relevant as complexity increases:

	- ### Development Guiding Principles
		- elegant
		- modular & flexible
			- Clean interfaces should exist for external systems as well as between some internal systems.
			- external systems and developer content should be handled through interfaces that are flexible to support a "plug and play" capacity.
		- "tell, don't ask" principle
		- interactivity
			- Bias toward supporting visual or design cues corresponding to code changes and app state.

	- only one element: a line of text
		- the last word in the line of text gets swapped out for another word every two seconds.
		- word list:
			- AI Kassandra provides [___].
				- guidance
				- reframing
				- insight
				- clarity
				- validation
				- confidence
	- The style
		- Later on we'll focus on the visual design, until then the visual design should be minimal.
			- To begin, the colors should communicate: 'dark mode' and 'creamy'
